            <div class="col-lg-8 mt-5">
                <p class="text-muted">However, as the space keeps expanding and people proceed to mint thousands of NFTs
                    every day, an important question arises - how do we make sure that all that creative work remains
                    accessible over time?</p>

                <p class="text-muted">Earlier this year, as NFTs began hitting the mainstream, the industry faced a
                    major technical problem. As highlighted by some analysts, most of the JPEGs (or other file formats)
                    that serve as the media basis for their respective NFTs weren't stored on the chain itself. Instead,
                    NFTs often simply redirected to a URL where the corresponding media was hosted - in most cases, that
                    was a separate domain that belonged to either the creator or the platform where that NFT was minted.
                </p>

                <p class="text-muted">But what happens when those domains go down? With that discovery, it became
                    apparent that some NFTs have a single point of failure, which, in turn, could significantly impact
                    their longevity and value.</p>

                <p class="text-muted mb-0">In light of that, numerous projects and organisations have begun working on a
                    potential fix. In a recent Clubhouse session, we brought those pioneering protocols and projects -
                    Protocol Labs (an open-source lab that is working on Filecoin, IPFS and libp2p), Async.art, Fleek
                    and Arweave - together to have a constructive discussion about the future of NFT metadata. Here's a
                    concise recap of the main ideas that were discussed there.</p>

                <div class="px-4 py-5 rounded-md bg-soft-primary text-center mt-4">
                    <h4 class="mb-0">" Thinking about giving the gift of an NFT? What to know about digital tokens "
                    </h4>
                </div>

                <div class="mt-4">
                    <img src="../../assets/images/blog/10.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded-md shadow" alt="">
                </div>

                <h5 class="mt-4 mb-0">What's an NFT?</h5>
                <p class="text-muted mt-4">This is the part that takes a bit of open-mindedness. An NFT is a unique
                    digital token, with most using the ethereum blockchain to digitally record transactions. It's not a
                    cryptocurrency like bitcoin or ether, because those are fungible -- exchangeable for another bitcoin
                    or cash. NFTs are recorded in a digital ledger in the same way as cryptocurrency, so there's a
                    listing of who owns each one.</p>

                <p class="text-muted mb-0">What makes an NFT unique is the digital asset tied to the token. This can be
                    an image, video, tweet or piece of music that's uploaded to a marketplace, which creates the NFT to
                    be sold.</p>
